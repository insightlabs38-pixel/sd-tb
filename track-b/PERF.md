# Track B: performance log

The independent development repository is not the official submission. Board run IDs and official K values must be recorded by the official integrator after verified promotions.

## Local, non-scoring evidence (synthetic inputs)

On the same in-chat Linux host and 100,000-document/20,000-query synthetic workload (75,307,568 input document bytes), baseline wall time was 22.97 s and peak RSS 205,608 KiB. The automaton variant took 3.05 s and peak RSS 206,108 KiB, with identical SHA-256 output (`ebe9a652d36670f1fa07f61a0e0121dbdac27c34cc289ab4ec86418f8abb097a`). This is a 7.53x local speedup on this synthetic workload, not an organizer benchmark.

On a separate 250,000-document/50,000-query synthetic workload (188,596,118 document bytes), the automaton variant took 12.81 s with peak RSS 505,532 KiB. These inputs differ from the official generator and must not be used as official scores.
